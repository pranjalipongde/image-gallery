# Image Gallery Project

## Overview

This is a simple Image Gallery application built using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The application fetches images from the [Picsum API](https://picsum.photos/) and displays them in a grid layout. The gallery supports infinite scrolling with a "Load More" button. The header of the site is fixed at the top of the page, and includes a site logo, title, and a background image with overlay text.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The gallery is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- Infinite Scrolling: Images are loaded in batches as the user clicks the "Load More" button.
- Fixed Transparent Header: The header remains fixed at the top of the page.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: For building the user interface and managing state.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling the components with a modern, responsive design.
- Picsum API: For fetching random images.
